# Collaboration

The Koji Web Editor was built from the ground up to facilite collaborative 
pair-programming. You can invite anyone with a Koji account to join your editor 
session and work on code together at the same time, like Google Docs.

Simply click "Collaborate" in the top bar of the Koji Web Editor to create an 
access link. The link will be valid for 15 minutes, and when someone opens the 
link, you will see a popup in your editor asking whether or not you want to let 
them join your session.

If you approve them, they'll join your session and be able to see the file and 
terminal that you currently have open. Users who join as collaborators are not 
able to open files in your project, they only see what you show them.

Collaborating users are not able to create, rename, or delete files in your
project. They are also not able to spawn or kill terminals.

When you're done collaborating, you can click their profile picture in the top 
navigation bar to end the session, or ask them to close their tab. Once they 
are disconnected, they will not be able to rejoin the project unless you 
approve them via the link and popup.
